These tests come from the MIT-licenses
[indexedDBmock](https://github.com/kristofdegrave/indexedDBmock)
(courtesy of [idb-polyfill](https://github.com/treojs/idb-polyfill))
as of 2015-05-07. The only difference is that index.html was changed a bit
to make it run. Besides that, newer versions of those tests should just work if
they're dropped in here and the reference in index.html is updated.

Run these tests in Node by running `npm run mock`.

Todo: Add to `devDependencies` routine (and also add to `licenseInfo.json`
      to be kept abreast of any license changes).
