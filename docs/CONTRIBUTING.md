This repository uses [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/axemclion/indexeddbshim)
for running the continuous integration (CI) tests. It uses [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com)
to run automated test cases on different browsers. The Sauce Labs server can
be only accessed using a secure environment variable that is not accessible
in pull requests.

Thank you for submitting a patch to this project; we really appreciate it.
Here is a quick overview of the process used to ensure that pull requests
do not break existing functionality.

1. Send a pull request with your changes to `master` branch
1. Travis runs ESLint, creates `./dist` files and executes the tests in
    `./test` on your pull request. The Travis CI Build must succeed.
    Please correct any errors.
1. Your pull request is merged into `master` at the discretion of the
    project collaborators.
