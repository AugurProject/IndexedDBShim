# Version 4.0.0

## Breaking changes from version 3.* to 4.0.0

- ***WARNING***: If you need 4.0.0 to work with data stored under 3.\*, you
    need to add a callback as the value of the new
    `CFG.registerSCA` config with a value set to the function exported from [typeson-registry-sca-reverter](https://github.com/brettz9/typeson-registry-sca-reverter),
    and do so before you make your `indexedDB` calls. This code was part of
    IndexedDBShim, but is no longer bundled with it, as IndexedDBShim, as of
    version 4.0.0 is now using the new typeson-registry Structured Cloning
    Algorithm format by default for representing cloneable data as JSON.
- Representation of Arrays were changed to allow storage of non-index
    properties (courtesy of updated typeson-registry)
- Representation of Blobs was changed to store as binary to avoid UTF16
    representation dropping unpaired surrogates (courtesy of updated
    typeson-registry); also assumes XHR has `overrideMimeType`
- Breaking change: `webkitGetDatabaseNames` removed in favor of now-standard
    `databases` (see <https://github.com/w3c/IndexedDB/pull/240/files>)
- We removed **Bower** support completely (the service has deprecated itself
    per <https://bower.io>). npm or yarn can be used instead.
- Due to changes from Babel 6 to Babel 7, the polyfill required for
    IndexedDB to work on older browsers and environments (assuming
    IndexedDBShim currently supports them), **script tag references to
    `node_modules`-based paths of `babel-polyfill`** will need to be
    changed to `@babel/polyfill`
- **`IDBDatabase.prototype.transaction`'s second argument'** had previously
    accepted **numeric constants** in IndexedDB, but IndexedDBShim deprecated
    their use, and now we are dropping support. Please use `"readonly"` or
    `"readwrite"` instead.
- We removed our non-standard **`IDBFactory.modules`** as this legacy holder
    of non-IDB shims such as `DOMException` are already available as shims or
    polyfills by using `CFG.addNonIDBGlobals` or `CFG.replaceNonIDBGlobals`,
    respectively, with shim names prefixing class names with "Shim".
- We removed our non-standard **`IDBFactory.utils`** and moved its
    test utility **`createDOMException`** to become a named export of
    `setGlobalVars.js`
