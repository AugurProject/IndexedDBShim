# Version 3.0.0

## Breaking changes from version 2.* to 3.0.0

Besides some backward-breaking (though standard-compliant) behavioral fixes
(see [CHANGES](CHANGES.md)), there are changes in version 3 which also
unfortunately cause data stored under version 2 to break. We are not
able to provide you with an automated upgrade path, so you will need to
either stick with version 2 or migrate users' data yourself to the new
SQL storage format (whose changes are considerable; [CHANGES](CHANGES.md)
also lists these breaking database format changes).

We have attempted to anticipate future changes so that for another upgrade,
even a major one, old data will hopefully continue to work. However, to be
safe, if you are using npm, be sure to specify semver targets in your
dependencies properly so as to avoid allowing for automated upgrades to
the next major version in case another future upgrade may also need to
introduce breaking changes to the data format, thereby breaking old data.
